### Steps to run the program

1. Install the necessary packages
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Run the program
   `python server.py`

3. Join a room. Currently the functionality is limited and you'll need to join a room manually
eg: 
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/join?room_id=room1&display_name=example_name&mute_audio=0&mute_video=1
```
