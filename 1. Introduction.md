## AWS Global Infrastructure

- Regions
  - Locations where AWS Servers are present.
  - A region is a cluster of data centers
  - Most AWS services are region-scoped. That is, if you use a service in one region and try using that service in another region, that service will be timed differently
  - Have names such as us-east-1, ap-south-1 etc
  - Eg: Mumbai, N. California, N. Virginia etc
- Availability Zones
  - Each region has multiple availability zones, usually 3. Minimum is 3, maximum is 6
  - Each availability zone consists of 1 or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity.
  - The availability zones are seperated from each other so that they are isolated from each other
  - They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking

### How to choose an AWS Region?

- It depends on various factors

1. **Compliance**: Should be compliant with data governance and legal requirements. Sometimes governments want the data to be local to the region you are staying in.
2. **Proximity to customers**: Go for a region where customers experience the lowest latency/lag
3. **Available Services within a region**: New services and new features aren't available in every region. Go for the region that has the services you want
4. **Pricing**: Pricing varies from region to region. You need to consult the services pricing page.
